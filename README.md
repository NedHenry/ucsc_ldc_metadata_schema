# Metadata Schema for the UCSC Library Digital Collections Repository
This github repository is intended for version control of the metadata schema for the UCSC Library Digital Collections website. The UCSC LDC site is a Hyrax based DAMS using Fedora 4 as a backend. 

## Schema File Formats
The draft schema was originally created as a Google Sheets spreadsheet. It was then exported as both a CSV file and an Excel file, both of which are imported here. Ideally, whenever updates are made, they should be made to both files.
